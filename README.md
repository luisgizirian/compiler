# compiler

The project is based on a sample lesson I asked GH Copilot to put together on writing a compiler for a simple C style language. Its not intended to be a usable or even complete project. It's more on the realms of becoming a learning journey throughout the intricacies of compiler programming and building. Many unknowns yet.
